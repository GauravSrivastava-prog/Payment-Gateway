## Introduction

This project serves as a minimalistic example of a payment gateway system. It allows users to input payment information such as card number, CVV, and payment type through a simple HTML form. The Flask server receives this information, processes it, and prints it to the console as a demonstration of functionality.

## Features

- User-friendly HTML form for inputting payment information.
- Server-side processing of payment data using Flask.
- Demonstrates basic validation and processing of payment information.
- Utilizes minimal JavaScript for form handling within HTML.
- Ready-to-use template for building upon or integrating into larger projects.
